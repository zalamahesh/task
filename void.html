 The following link does nothing because the expression "0" has no effect in JavaScript. 
 Here the expression "0" is evaluated, but it is not loaded back into the current document.

    <a href = "javascript:void(document.write('hello'))">Click me!</a>      
<!--
We can use the operand 0 in two ways that are void(0) or void 0. Both of the ways work the same. 
The JavaScript:void(0) tells the browser to "do nothing" i.e., prevents the browser from reloading or refreshing the page. 
It is useful when we insert links that have some important role on the webpage without any reloading.
 So, using void(0) on such links prevents the reloading of the page but allows to perform a useful function such as updating a value on the webpage.
